# Features Folder

This folder organizes the app by **features** or **functional areas**. Think of each feature folder as a small mini-app inside your project.

Each feature folder usually contains:

- **Pages:** These are the screens or views users see related to the feature.
- **API logic:** Code that talks to the backend or fetches data needed for this feature.
- **State management:** Pieces of code that handle the data and state for the feature (for example, Redux slices).

By keeping everything related to one feature together, itâ€™s easier to:

- Find code quickly
- Make changes without affecting other features
- Work with team members on different features at the same time
