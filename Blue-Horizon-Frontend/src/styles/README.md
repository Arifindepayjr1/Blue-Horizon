# Styles Folder

This folder contains **global styles and configuration** for the app’s appearance.  
It can include CSS files, Tailwind CSS config, or other style-related setups.

Common files are:

- `index.css` — global CSS rules applied across the app  
- `tailwind.config.js` — configuration file for Tailwind CSS framework  

Keeping styles centralized here helps maintain consistent design and easy customization.
